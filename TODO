- yoda isn't safe wrt eg implicit call parens
- code path analysis needs to actually understand for when, since it considers anything after a for when whose body returns to be unreachable? or is eslint-plugin-known-imports using outdated?

- figure out how to not commit lib/ and publish to npm
- restrict eslint peerDependency range or detect version - looks like eg ast-utils has moved to lib/util/ast-utils
- should we always be parsing as module?
- expose prettier/prettier w/ prettier-plugin-coffeescript config set up eg as plugin:coffee/prettier?
- add test like eslint-plugin-react (?) that checks that everything in src/rules/ is exposed
- monkeypatch code path analysis
- comprehensively go through expected token types and include in espreeTokenTypes
- include tests from coffeelint?
- didn't include tests for first couple rules
- add excludeLoop option to no-constant-condition?
- documentation
- code path analysis for optional call/member expressions?

rule ideas:
- no-unnecessary-fat-arrow
- prefer-implicit-return
- prefer-unless
- comprehension-parens (somewhat like coffeelint ensure_comprehensions, but maybe have options for assignment (eg a = b for b in c), inlineFunction (eg a = -> b for b in c))?
